Now enable trusted publishing so CI can release future versions:
  1. Open https://www.npmjs.com/package/$name/access
  2. Add Trusted Publisher -> GitHub Actions:
       organization or user: zgeoff
       repository:           slooks
       workflow filename:    main.yml
       environment:          (leave empty)
